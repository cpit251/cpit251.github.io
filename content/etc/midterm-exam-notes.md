## Type of questions
The questions will be in the form of brief questions that require written answers of a few sentences.

### Preparation
The questions are based on key concepts and test your understanding to these concepts as opposed to memorizing them. It's about knowing the materials, so don't just memorize. Understand.
You may prepare for this exam by reviewing the textbook, lecture slides, lecture notes, and assigned readings.

You should be able to define terms and concepts as well as providing examples for each concept, so you can organize your ideas and articulate your answers. Try to distinguish between closely related methods or frameworks and understand the benefits and limitations of each one (e.g., when it's the right time/stage of the software development cycle to use it?). You should also be able to provide answers that demonstrate the technical background you have gained to use a variety of tools as a Software Engineers to apply the key concepts in building software applications.
